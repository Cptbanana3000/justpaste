            Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling plain
            text. It allows you to add formatting elements like headings, bold
            text, lists, and links without using a complex editor. Its simplicity
            and portability make it the perfect choice for quick notes,
            checklists, and documentation—especially in tools like Flingnote.
            This guide will walk you through the essentials and provide some
            advanced tips to make your notes more effective.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Use Markdown? The Three Core Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into the syntax, it's helpful to understand why
            Markdown has become so popular among writers, developers, and
            productivity enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>It’s Easy to Read and Write:</strong> The syntax is intuitive
              and unobtrusive. Even in its raw, plain-text form, a Markdown
              document is clean and readable. You don't need to be a technical
              expert to start writing well-formatted documents immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It’s Fast and Efficient:</strong> With no buttons to click
              or menus to navigate, you can format text as you type. This keeps
              you in the flow and makes the writing process much faster than
              with traditional word processors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It’s Platform Independent:</strong> Markdown is just text.
              This means a file you create can be opened on any device or
              operating system. It’s supported by countless applications, from
              note-taking apps like Flingnote to code editors and project
              management tools, ensuring your content is never locked into a
              single platform.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Fundamentals: Core Markdown Syntax</h2>
          <p>
            Mastering these basic elements will allow you to handle 90% of your
            formatting needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Headings</h3>
          <p>
            Use the hash symbol (<code>#</code>) to create headings. The number
            of hashes corresponds to the heading level. It's good practice to
            use a single <code># H1</code> for your main title and then use
            <code>## H2</code> for major sections and
            <code>### H3</code> for subsections.
          </p>
          <pre><code># Main Title (Level 1)
## A Major Section (Level 2)
### A Subsection (Level 3)
#### A Sub-subsection (Level 4)</code></pre>

          <h3>Emphasis</h3>
          <p>
            You can make text bold or italic using asterisks (<code>*</code>) or
            underscores (<code>_</code>).
          </p>
          <pre><code>*This text will be italic.*
_This will also be italic._

**This text will be bold.**
__This will also be bold.__

You can even combine them: ***This text is bold and italic.***</code></pre>

          <h3>Lists</h3>
          <p>
            Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted)
            lists. For unordered lists, you can use a dash (<code>-</code>), an
            asterisk (<code>*</code>), or a plus sign (<code>+</code>).
          </p>
          <pre><code>- First item
- Second item
  - A nested item
- Third item

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item</code></pre>

          <h3>Checklists (Task Lists)</h3>
          <p>
            A great feature for productivity, task lists allow you to create
            interactive checklists.
          </p>
          <pre><code>- [ ] An incomplete task
- [x] A completed task</code></pre>

          <h3>Links</h3>
          <p>
            Create a hyperlink by wrapping the link text in brackets
            <code>[]</code> and the URL in parentheses <code>()</code>.
          </p>
          <pre><code>Visit [Flingnote](https://flingnote.click) to get started.</code></pre>

          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            Sharing code is one of Markdown's greatest strengths. For a short,
            inline piece of code, wrap it in backticks (<code>`</code>). For a
            larger block of code, use triple backticks (<code>```</code>), and
            optionally add a language identifier for syntax highlighting.
          </p>
          <pre><code>Inline code example: `npm install express`

Fenced code block with syntax highlighting:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet('World');
```</code></pre>

          <h2>Going Further: Advanced Formatting</h2>
          <p>
            Once you're comfortable with the basics, these elements can add more
            structure and clarity to your notes.
          </p>

          <h3>Blockquotes</h3>
          <p>
            To create a blockquote, add a <code>&gt;</code> in front of a
            paragraph. This is useful for quoting people or highlighting
            important passages.
          </p>
          <pre><code>&gt; "The secret of getting ahead is getting started."
&gt;
&gt; - Mark Twain</code></pre>

          <h3>Tables</h3>
          <p>
            Creating tables is a bit more involved but incredibly useful for
            organizing data. Use pipes (<code>|</code>) to separate columns and
            hyphens (<code>-</code>) to create the header row's separator. Colons
            (<code>:</code>) can be used to align columns.
          </p>
          <pre><code>| Syntax      | Description |
| :---------- | :---------: |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |</code></pre>

          <h3>Horizontal Rules</h3>
          <p>
            To create a horizontal rule for a thematic break, use three or more
            asterisks, dashes, or underscores on a line by themselves.
          </p>
          <pre><code>---</code></pre>

          <h2>Tips for Better Markdown Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Stick to one style for lists (e.g.,
              always use dashes) and emphasis. Consistency makes your notes
              easier to read and edit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Whitespace:</strong> Don't be afraid to use empty lines
              between elements to create visual separation. It makes the raw
              text much easier to scan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Preview Your Work:</strong> Tools like Flingnote offer a
              live preview. Use it to ensure your formatting is correct before
              you share your note.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With these fundamentals, you're ready to create clean, readable, and
            highly portable notes. The more you use Markdown, the more it will
            become second nature, speeding up your workflow and helping you
            communicate your ideas more effectively.
