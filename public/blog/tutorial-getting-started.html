            Welcome to Flingnote! Our goal is to provide the fastest and simplest
            way to save and share text online, with no accounts, no friction,
            and a deep respect for your privacy. This tutorial will walk you
            through the entire process, from writing your first note to sharing
            and editing it. In just a few minutes, you'll be a Flingnote pro.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1: Write Your Note with Markdown</h2>
          <p>
            Everything starts on the Flingnote homepage. You'll see a large,
            clean text editor waiting for your content. You can either start
            typing directly or paste in text from another source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flingnote fully supports Markdown, a simple syntax for formatting
            your text. As you type, you can use common Markdown syntax to add
            structure and emphasis. For example:
          </p>
          <pre><code># This is a main heading
## This is a sub-heading

Here is some regular text. To make text **bold**, surround it with two asterisks.
To make it *italic*, use one asterisk.

- Create a bulleted list with dashes
- It's great for organizing ideas

1. Create a numbered list for steps
2. It's easy to follow</code></pre>
          <p>
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the "Preview" tab above the editor to
            see a live-rendered version of your Markdown. This allows you to
            check your formatting in real-time, ensuring your note looks
            exactly the way you want it to before you save.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 2: Save Your Note and Get Your Links</h2>
          <p>
            Once you're happy with your note, simply click the "Save Note"
            button. In an instant, Flingnote will save your content and take you
            to a confirmation page. This page contains two crucial pieces of
            information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The View Link:</strong> This is the public URL for your
              note (e.g., `flingnote.click/aB1cDe`). This is the link you will
              share with others. Anyone with this link can view your note.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Secret Edit Code:</strong> This is a unique, randomly
              generated code that grants you permission to edit the note. It is
              vital that you <strong>keep this code private</strong>. Treat it
              like a password. You can also use the "Edit Link," which has the
              edit code embedded in it for convenience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Be sure to copy and save your Edit Code or Edit Link in a safe
            place if you think you'll need to make changes later.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 3: Share Your Note with the World</h2>
          <p>
            Now it's time to share. Simply copy the "View Link" and send it to
            anyone, anywhere. You can paste it into an email, a chat message, a
            forum post, or a social media update. The recipient can click the
            link and instantly view your formatted note on any device, with no
            need to log in or create an account. It's a completely frictionless
            experience for them.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 4: Edit Your Note (If Needed)</h2>
          <p>
            Need to fix a typo or add an update? There are two ways to edit an
            existing note:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Using the Edit Link:</strong> If you saved the full Edit
              Link, simply visiting that URL in your browser will automatically
              load the note in the editor and grant you editing privileges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Using the Edit Code:</strong> If you only have the View
              Link, navigate to it. Then, click the "Edit Note" button. You will
              be prompted to enter your secret Edit Code. Paste it in, and
              you'll be able to make your changes.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Once you've finished your edits, click the "Update Note" button to
            save the new version.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Tips for Success</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Checklists for Tasks:</strong> Get organized by using
              Markdown's task list syntax (`- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for
              done).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Highlight Your Code:</strong> When sharing code, always use
              fenced code blocks with a language identifier (e.g.,
              <code>```javascript</code>) for beautiful syntax highlighting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep it Scannable:</strong> Use headings and short
              paragraphs. Your readers, especially on mobile, will thank you.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Thatâ€™s all there is to it! You are now ready to create, share, and
            manage notes quickly and efficiently. Welcome to the simple, fast
            world of Flingnote.
