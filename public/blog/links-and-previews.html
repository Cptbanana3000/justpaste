            Links are the connective tissue of the web, turning static documents
            into dynamic, interconnected resources. In a shared note, a
            well-placed link can provide crucial context, cite a source, or
            guide a reader to the next step. However, how you format and present
            those links can make the difference between a helpful resource and a
            confusing mess. Hereâ€™s how to make your links work harder and smarter
            in every note you share.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Use Descriptive Text: Say What You Mean</h2>
          <p>
            The most common mistake people make is using generic phrases like
            "click here" or pasting a raw URL. This practice is bad for clarity,
            accessibility, and professionalism. The text of a link should
            describe the destination. It sets the reader's expectation and makes
            your document scannable.
          </p>

          <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>For more information, refer to the official [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).</code></pre>
          <p>
            The "After" example is superior because the reader knows exactly
            what they will get before they click.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Group Related Links for Clarity</h2>
          <p>
            Avoid scattering dozens of links throughout your text without any
            organization. A long, unstructured "link dump" can be overwhelming
            and unhelpful. If you have multiple resources to share, group them
            under a clear heading like "References," "Further Reading," or
            "Helpful Tools."
          </p>
          <p>
            This creates a clean, dedicated section that readers can easily
            scan.

- [Staging Server](https://staging.example.com)</code></pre>

          <h2>3. Context is King: Explain Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            A link without context is a mystery. Why should the reader click it?
            What will they find there? Adding a short, one-sentence description
            can dramatically increase the value of a link. This is especially
            important when sharing a list of resources.

- [Stack Overflow Discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345): A helpful thread that explains the bug we encountered.</code></pre>

          <h2>4. Be Mindful of Link Previews</h2>
          <p>
            Most modern chat and collaboration platforms (like Slack, Discord,
            and Microsoft Teams) automatically generate a preview when you post
            a link. This preview typically includes the page title, a short
            description, and an image. When you share a Flingnote link, the
            first few lines of your note will likely become this preview.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep this in mind when writing the beginning of your note. A clear,
            concise opening will create a much more useful preview when the link
            is shared. Also, be aware of the privacy implications; a preview
            might inadvertently display sensitive information from the top of
            your note.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion: Links as a Sign of Quality</h2>
          <p>
            Treating links with care is a small habit that has a big impact.
            Clear, contextual, and well-organized links make your notes more
            usable, professional, and trustworthy. They show respect for your
            reader's time and attention. By following these simple best
            practices, you can turn your shared notes from simple text dumps
            into valuable, easy-to-navigate resources.
