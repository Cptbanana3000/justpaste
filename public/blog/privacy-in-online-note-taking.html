          <p>
            Privacy is more than a buzzword—it’s a core part of how we write,
            store, and share information online. In note-taking, privacy
            controls how comfortable you feel capturing ideas.
          </p>
          <h2>Minimal Data by Design</h2>
          <p>
            Tools that avoid accounts and unnecessary telemetry reduce risk and
            friction. With Flingnote, you can share text with minimal overhead.
          </p>
          <h2>Public vs. Private</h2>
          <p>
            Public links are convenient, but remember shared links are visible
            to anyone with the URL. Avoid storing sensitive or personal data in
            public notes.
          </p>
          <h2>Threat Models</h2>
          <p>
            Ask what you’re protecting: personal details, credentials, or
            confidential docs? Pick your tools accordingly and avoid public
            sharing for sensitive content.
          </p>
          <h2>Best Practices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Strip personal info from public notes.</li>
            <li>Use neutral language and minimal metadata.</li>
            <li>Rotate or remove content when it’s no longer needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Practical, Not Paranoid</h2>
          <p>
            Privacy is about sensible defaults and habits, not fear. With
            lightweight tools and clear boundaries, you can share knowledge
            without oversharing.
