            Consistency is the hallmark of professional and readable
            documentation. When you're writing notes, especially ones that will
            be shared with others, adopting a simple style guide can make your
            content significantly easier to read, understand, and maintain. A
            style guide isn't about rigid, restrictive rules; it's about making
            conscious choices to create a consistent experience for your
            readers. By adopting a few simple standards, you can ensure your
            Markdown notes are always clear and effective.
          </p>

          <h2>Why a Style Guide Matters</h2>
          <p>
            A consistent style reduces cognitive load on the reader. When
            headings, lists, and code blocks always look and feel the same, the
            reader can focus on the content itself, not on deciphering the
            structure. This is especially critical in technical documentation or
            collaborative notes where clarity is paramount.
          </p>

          <h2>Headings: The Backbone of Your Document</h2>
          <p>
            Headings provide the primary structure for your note. Using them
            correctly is crucial for readability and accessibility.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use a Single H1:</strong> A document should only have one
              main title, created with a single hash (`#`). This should be the
              very first thing in your note.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start Sections with H2:</strong> All major sections of your
              document should begin with a level-two heading (`##`).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don't Skip Levels:</strong> Maintain a logical hierarchy.
              Never jump from an `H2` directly to an `H4`. If you need a
              sub-section within an `H2`, use an `H3` (`###`). This is vital for
              screen readers and automated document parsers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Lists: For Clarity and Scannability</h2>
          <p>
            Lists are perfect for breaking down complex information into
            digestible points.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose One Bullet Style:</strong> For unordered lists,
              Markdown allows you to use dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus
              signs (`+`). Pick one (dashes are a common and clean choice) and
              stick with it throughout your document for a consistent look.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Ordered Lists for Steps:</strong> If the order of items
              matters, such as in a tutorial or a checklist of sequential tasks,
              always use a numbered list.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep List Items Parallel:</strong> Try to start each item in a
              list with the same part of speech (e.g., all verbs) and keep the
              phrasing consistent. This makes the list much easier to scan.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Code: For Readability and Safety</h2>
          <p>
            Properly formatted code is essential in any technical note.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Inline Code for Identifiers:</strong> Use single
              backticks (<code>`</code>) to wrap variable names, function names,
              filenames (`script.js`), and terminal commands (`npm install`).
              This visually separates them from the surrounding text.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Always Add Language Tags:</strong> As mentioned in our other
              guides, always add a language identifier to your fenced code
              blocks (e.g., <code>```python</code>) to enable syntax
              highlighting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep Lines to a Reasonable Length:</strong> For readability,
              try to keep lines of code under 80 characters. While not a strict
              rule, it prevents horizontal scrolling, which is particularly
              disruptive on mobile devices.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Links: For Context and Trust</h2>
          <p>
            Links should be clear and descriptive, never ambiguous.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Descriptive Text:</strong> The link's text should
              describe its destination. Avoid generic phrases like "click
              here." Instead of `Click here for the docs`, use `Read the
              [official documentation](...)`.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider Reference-Style Links:</strong> For notes with many
              links, you can use reference-style links to keep the main body of
              text clean. This involves defining the URL at the bottom of your
              document.
            </li>
          </ul>
