            It's a simple fact of the modern web: the majority of your readers
            will open your notes on a mobile device. A note that looks perfectly
            structured on a wide desktop monitor can quickly become an
            unreadable "wall of text" on a small phone screen. To ensure your
            message gets across effectively, you need to adopt a mobile-first
            mindset when writing. Here are some simple but powerful techniques
            to keep your content readable, scannable, and engaging on any
            screen size.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Embrace Brevity: Write Concise Sections</h2>
          <p>
            The single most important rule for mobile readability is to keep
            your paragraphs short. On a narrow screen, even a moderately sized
            paragraph can fill the entire viewport, forcing the reader to scroll
            endlessly. This creates cognitive friction and makes it easy to lose
            one's place.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Break It Down:</strong> Aim for paragraphs that are no more
              than three to four sentences long. If a single idea takes longer
              to explain, consider breaking it into a bulleted list.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid Long Code Blocks:</strong> A wide block of code is
              often the biggest offender of mobile layouts, forcing horizontal
              scrolling. If you must share a large snippet, consider sharing
              only the most relevant part or linking out to a full version on a
              platform like GitHub Gist or another Flingnote.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Use Meaningful Headings as Signposts</h2>
          <p>
            On a desktop, a reader can see the entire structure of your document
            at a glance. On mobile, they can only see a small portion at a time.
            This makes headings incredibly importantâ€”they act as signposts that
            allow the reader to scan the document and jump to the sections that
            are most relevant to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            A well-structured note with clear, descriptive headings is a gift to
            your mobile reader. It allows them to quickly understand the main
            points of your note without having to read every single word.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Poor Structure (Hard to Scan):</strong></p>
          <pre><code>My Project Update
We started the new feature and ran into a bug with the API. The authentication
token wasn't being passed correctly. We fixed it by updating the header. The
next step is to work on the UI.</code></pre>
          <p><strong>Good Structure (Easy to Scan):</strong></p>
          <pre><code># Project Update

## What We Did
- Started work on the new user profile feature.

## Blockers
- Encountered a bug where the API authentication token was not being passed.
- **Fix:** Updated the request header to include the correct token.

## Next Steps
- Begin development on the UI components.</code></pre>

          <h2>3. Link Out Wisely to Keep Your Note Tidy</h2>
          <p>
            Your note doesn't have to contain every single piece of
            information. Use links to "outsource" dense or secondary content.
            This keeps your main note focused, clean, and fast-loading.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Link to Sources:</strong> Instead of pasting long quotes or
              articles, summarize the key point and link to the original
              source.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Link to Data:</strong> Don't paste a massive log file or a
              huge JSON object. Put it in its own Flingnote and link to it from
              your main note.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Descriptive Links:</strong> As always, ensure your link
              text describes the destination. This helps the reader decide if
              they need to tap on the link for more information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Be Careful with Tables</h2>
          <p>
            Markdown tables are a great way to display structured data, but they
            can be problematic on mobile. A table with many columns will almost
            always break the layout on a narrow screen, forcing horizontal
            scrolling. If you must use a table, try to keep it to two or three
            columns at most. For more complex data, it's often better to use a
            series of lists and headings instead.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion: A Mobile-First Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            Creating mobile-friendly notes isn't about learning complex code;
            it's about empathy for your reader. By writing in short, concise
            sections, using clear headings as signposts, and linking out to
            heavier content, you create a reading experience that is pleasant
            and effective on any device. A mobile-first note is one that
            respects the reader's time and attention, which ultimately makes
            your message more impactful.
