            One of the biggest challenges of using a minimalist, account-free
            note-taking system is organization. Without the built-in folders,
            tags, and search capabilities of larger applications, how do you
            prevent your notes from becoming a scattered, disconnected mess? The
            answer lies in adopting simple, text-based conventions that add
            structure and discoverability to your content. Here are several
            lightweight systems that work surprisingly well, allowing you to
            organize your notes without sacrificing speed or simplicity.
          </p>

          <h2>The Philosophy: Structure Should Not Be a Burden</h2>
          <p>
            The key to successful organization in a minimalist system is to
            ensure that the act of organizing never becomes more work than the
            note-taking itself. The methods below are designed to be lightweight
            and incremental. You can apply them as needed, without feeling pressured
            to build a complex system from day one.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Inline Tags: Simple and Direct</h2>
          <p>
            This is the most straightforward method. At the very bottom of your
            note, simply add a line prefixed with "Tags:" and list relevant
            keywords. This makes it easy to search for all notes related to a
            topic using your computer's built-in file search or a command-line
            tool like `grep`.
          </p>
          <pre><code>... (content of your note) ...

---
Tags: productivity, howto, cli, linux</code></pre>
          <p>
            This approach is simple, unobtrusive, and requires zero setup.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Section-Based Tags</h2>
          <p>
            A slightly more structured version of inline tags is to create a
            dedicated "Tags" or "Metadata" section in your note, typically at
            the end. This is useful if you want to include more than just tags,
            such as a creation date or a status.
          </p>
          <pre><code>... (content of your note) ...

## Metadata
- **Status:** Draft
- **Created:** 2023-10-27
- **Tags:** javascript, api, tutorial</code></pre>

          <h2>3. Contextual Hashtags for Discoverability</h2>
          <p>
            Hashtags (`#topic`) are a powerful way to add context directly
            within your sentences. While Flingnote itself doesn't have a hashtag
            system, these tags become incredibly useful when you share your
            notes or copy them into other systems like Slack, Twitter, or a
            personal wiki that *do* support hashtag-based search.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using hashtags within your text makes your notes instantly more
            discoverable in the broader digital ecosystem where they are likely
            to be shared.
          </p>
          <pre><code>Today's meeting on the #Q4-roadmap focused on our new #API-strategy.</code></pre>

          <h2>4. The Index Note (or "Link Hub")</h2>
          <p>
            This is arguably the most powerful strategy for building a true
            knowledge base. It's the manual equivalent of a folder or a tag
            index. You create a central "Index" or "Hub" note that serves as a
            master table of contents for a specific project or topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever you create a new note related to that topic, you simply add
            a link to it in your Index note, along with a short description.
            Over time, this Index becomes a curated, easy-to-navigate portal to
            all your related content.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example Index Note (`My Project Hub`):</strong></p>
          <pre><code># My Project Hub

          <h2>Conclusion: Keep It Simple, Let It Evolve</h2>
          <p>
            You don't need a complex system from the start. Begin with simple
            inline tags. As your collection of notes grows, you might create an
            Index note for your most important project. The best system is the
            one you'll actually use, and these lightweight methods are designed
            to be so simple that they never get in your way. By adding just a
            little bit of intentional structure, you can turn a collection of
            simple notes into a powerful, interconnected web of knowledge.
